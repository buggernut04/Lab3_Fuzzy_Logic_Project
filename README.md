# Washing Machine Control System

Welcome to the Washing Machine Control System program! This Python application demonstrates the use of fuzzy logic to control washing time based on the dirt level and load size.

## How to Use
1. Run `washing_machine_control.py`.
2. Provide input for dirt level (scale from 0 - 10) and load size percentage (0 - 100).
3. The system will compute and display the estimated washing time in hours.

## File Structure
- `washing_machine_control.py`: Fuzzy logic control system for washing machine.
